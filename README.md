# IntelliBrief

## What it does
🤖 IntelliBrief is an AI-Powered Note Summarizer and Quiz Generator. It uses your notes to generate a concise summary of the topic at hand while emphasizing the main topics. It also uses your notes to generate questions based on the notes in order to support active learning.

## Inspiration
My main inspiration for this project was Bloom's taxonomy of learning. Which is basically a classification of educational learning objectives. Most of our studying focuses on memory and remembering things, however, remembering is at the bottom of Bloom's taxonomy. IntelliBrief encourages students to understand and analyze the information they learn rather than simply remembering it. 💡

## How we built it
IntelliBrief was built with React, express.js, and Openai API.  🧑‍💻

## Challenges we ran into
This was my first time using Openai's chatgpt API so most of the problems were related to me figuring out how to implement the API 😅

## What's next for IntelliBrief
In the future, I hope to add mobile support so that users are able to take pictures of their notes and be able to instantly use IntelliBrief. 📲
